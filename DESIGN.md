## What does this package do?

`fysics` is designed to be an all-in one solution for State Management.

## How is it different from what I already use?

**WORK IN PROGRESS**: We are in the process of documenting the design for `fysics`.

## Why should I adopt it?

**WORK IN PROGRESS**: We are in the process of documenting the design for `fysics`.

## How do I contribute to this package?

`fysics` is a part of the [Open Source Universe](https://github.com/intellibus/approach). All Projects in the [Open Source Universe](https://github.com/intellibus/approach) follow the same [Contribution Guidelines & Process](https://github.com/intellibus/approach).

We would love for you to contribute to the [Open Source Universe](https://github.com/intellibus/approach)!

Also check out the [rewards](https://github.com/intellibus/approach/blob/main/REWARDS.md) offered for contributing to the [Open Source Universe](https://github.com/intellibus/approach).

## How do I adopt this design in my framework, language, etc.?

`fysics` only plans to initially support Typescript & JavaScript Applications. However, we would love for the community to contribute versions for other languages (Java, Go, etc.)

When creating an implementation for another language, we encourage that the implementation follow the [Open Source Universe](https://github.com/intellibus/approach) Principles & follows the same design (this document) & specifications (unit tests) as the Typescript & JavaScript Implementation.
